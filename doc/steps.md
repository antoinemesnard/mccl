# Definition of the project

[X] description of the goals
[] API description of the core objects
[] Prange's algorithm
[] Tests on small instances

- Agree on the representation choice.

# First step

## Core
[] Matrix operations, Gaussian elimination (compatible with submatrices, permutations)
[] Birthday search
[] Canteaut-Chabaud: only permute a small number of columns insteat of a full permutation

## Algorithms
[] Lee Brickel
[] Stern/Dumer

## Tools
[] Parser
[] Instance generator
[] Automatic suggestion of parameters (using CaWof)
[] Documentation on the implemented algorithms
[] Tests

- See the performance on challenge instances.
- Present the project to other members of the community for early feedback.

# Second step

## Algorithms
[] MMT
[] BJMM
